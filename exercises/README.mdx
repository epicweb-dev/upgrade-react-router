# Upgrade React Router ðŸ”¼

## NOTICE: This is incomplete.

I may finish making it a proper workshop with exercises and all that, but for
now, it's just a couple checkpoints. You can run it locally and check the diff
(or just check the
[diff tab in the deployed version](https://upgrade-react-router.epicweb.dev/diff)).
You'll want to check
[v5 vs v6](https://upgrade-react-router.epicweb.dev/diff?app1=01.01.problem&app2=50.01.problem)
and then
[v6 vs v7](https://upgrade-react-router.epicweb.dev/diff?app1=50.01.problem&app2=99.01.problem)
and then
[one more incremental improvement on v7](https://upgrade-react-router.epicweb.dev/diff?app1=99.01.problem&app2=99.01.solution).
